Powered by CI/CD, and Why Chatbette? ... Because Chatbot are Robot, and TOO MECHANICAL for her.
<h1>Why I called "Chatbette"</h1>

<p>For some reason. <b>"Chatbot"</b> is a developers trend for improving UX (User Experience) via message. But for me, the word <b>"Chatbot"</b> doesn't make sense for my (private) chatbots that I already have (if I called...). Because ... <b>All love these are female characters.</b> And the word "Chatbot" itself are robot-related, so I won't call that.
<h3>So where the "Chatbette" came from?</h3>
<p>It's Nintendo things.
  <br>Why not? Because 'Power Crown' from New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe that allow Toadette transform to Peachette, and fanart for transform Bowser to Bowsette. So if Chatbot has Power Crown too? It's <b>Chatbette</b>!
